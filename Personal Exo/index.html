  <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through
    my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>
  <div class="parallax"></div>
  <p> I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to practice; I like to think, I like to dream; I talk a little, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise
    in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing in me, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to browse the internet when I cannot sleep
    in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep late, I like to get up early; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’
    noise; I like the beautiful winds of the lake, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
  </p>

  <p> I always wanted to be a physicist, like Albert Einstein who headed "The Atomic Bomb", or like a computer consultant like Edward Snowden who copied and leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 without authorization.
    They have influenced millions of people through their acts. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like Dr. Carl lightman in the movie "Lie to Me". Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some googling, some
    freelance, and some learning. But my dream is still alive.
  </p>

  <p>This is a brief introduction of myself. If you are interested in knowing more, contact me and you'll probably write a book.</p>
